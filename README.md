# Component Lifecycle

The component lifecycle is the time period that begins at the creation of a component and lasts until the end and removal of it.  The component lifecycle has 3 stages: Mounting stage, Updating stage, and Unmounting stage.

## Stage 1 - Mounting stage
This stage marks the creation of the component and its insertion into the DOM.  The component will appear on the browser as html elements within the source code.  The can be done with Javascript's DOM manipulation or using JSX.


## Stage 2 - Updating stage
This stage handles the changes made to a component's state or props.


## Stage 3 - Unmounting stage
This stage marks the end of the component as it is subequently removed from the DOM.  The component will disappear from the browser.  Bascially, the html elements are removed from the browser source code.
